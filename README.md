# TBOG_Data

Collection of all The Body on Games heart-rate data in compressed CSV files.
*TBOG - Pulse - Search - Archive.r* is what collected the separate CSV and XLSX files, properly formatted them, and added a "Part" column to create the single CSV for export.

In addition to the data, R Shiny app files are also here; the basis for a web interface to view statistics and graphs from any of this data.
The app can be found here: https://guestjim.shinyapps.io/The_Body_on_Games-List/
